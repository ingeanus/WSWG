# WYSWG System
**_What You See_** is what you get **_War_** **_Gaming_** System


WYSWG is (being) designed around the idea of providing a ruleset that allows players to design and play their armies in whatever style and flavor they want while maintaining a sense of balance and fairness in their design. 
It is intend on being a system that can run any army "second best" — meaning that while its generic capabilities are not intended to perform better than a highly specialized system, it is capable of molding to the player's interests and designs in ways that will appeal more to those seeking personal and alternative styles.

Felt like the latest edition for your system ruined your army? Or perhaps the equipment you built for with no longer exists? Simply build their rules to match your intended flavor and ideas.

Wanted to play a match unlike any system you know of? Go ahead and pit your WW1 Line Infantry Horde against the small contingent of Time-Travelling Science Fiction Assassins that have come to kill King George V.

Want the ability to have a system that is pre-built for long term campaigns? The army design system inherently will allow you to upgrade and alter your units as the games progress. No more janky tools and prices that abstract out the finer details and leave you with precious few options that are both fun and useful (looking at you Necromunda).

WYSWG (will eventually) come with a multitude of pre-made units and selections as well, allowing those with less time to dedicate to design to simply pick up their "standard WW2 US Marine" for play — or to modify smaller bits to their likings!

Hopefully one day I'll design an app for it too.
